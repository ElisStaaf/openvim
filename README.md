# OpenVim
OpenVim is a text/code editor written in C that's focused on being as minimal
as possible, yet useful enough to be someones primary editor! It includes many
quality of life features such as syntax highlighting, find and replace and much,
much more. It's primarily just a passion project, but usable as a real editor!
